<HTML><BODY>When searching for works to offer at PGDP, I always try to find a mix of works that are still interesting today, add some diversity to the Project Gutenberg collection, or is of significant cultural or historical importance. Another criterium is that the works should be manageable by the volunteers here at PGDP. Folklore collections are always popular and interesting. Recently, I’ve added a couple of books with Hawaiian folk-lore, and digging deeper, I hit upon a mother-lode of these, the <i>Fornander collection of Hawaiian antiquities and folk-lore</i>, which is a huge collection of material collected in the late 19th century by Abraham Fornander, and which was published between 1916 and 1920, in three large volumes, by the Bishop Museum Press in Honolulu.

<p>The volumes are bilingual, with the English translation on the left and Hawaiian original on the right hand side page, but since Hawaiian doesn’t use any non-standard letters, it shouldn't be that hard. In fact, the Hawaiian alphabet is surprisingly short, with just 13 letters: five vowels: <b>a e i o u</b> (each with a long pronunciation and a short one) and eight consonants: <b>h k l m n p w</b>, and the glottal stop (not shown in this text). Since all syllables in Hawaiian are a single consonant followed by a vowel or diphthong, to us many words appear fairly long and repetitious — although there are also plenty of very short words to compensate. Only about 24000 speakers of Hawaiian remain, so the hope of finding many native speakers to help out with this is limited. Please help out with the Hawaiian pages, even if you don’t understand a single word (If you know some other Austronesian language, such as Malay or Tagalog, you might occasionally recognize a word, although it will take some linguistic training to point them out; if you know a Polynesian language as Tongan, Samoan, or Tahitian, it is much more recognizable).

</p><p>The formatting of the text is fairly straightforward. Most of it is in single column, with double column footnotes (but sometimes the footnotes are also single column), except for sections with songs, where the pages are double column (and footnotes single column). Please put all the footnotes under each other, each as a separate paragraph.

</p><p>During proofing, please freely suggest Hawaiian words in word-check, this will help us build up a spelling list.

</p><p>During PP, I will format the work in a two-column fashion (at least for the HTML version), as I have done for other, similar bilingual books (e.g. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/42884/42884-h/42884-h.htm#ittext">this one</a>).

</p><p>Have fun!
